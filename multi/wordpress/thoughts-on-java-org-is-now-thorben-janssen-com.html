But don&#8217;t worry, it&#8217;s only a different domain name and nothing really changed. Thoughts-on-java.org gets redirected toÂ thorben-janssen.com, all articles and courses are still there and you can keep all of your bookmarks.</p>



<p>I also implemented a small redesign. </p>



<p>Well, internally and especially technically, it was a bigger change. Until the end of last week, I used a theme and library that was very popular in 2015, when I switched my old blog to WordPress. But over the last 2 years, development on that library slowed down, and I felt like it was time to move one. I hope that the new one provides better performance and gives me more flexibility.</p>



<p>Please let me know in the comments how you like the new design or if there is anything that doesn&#8217;t work as you expected.</p></div><div class="col-lg-2 col-md-2 invisible"></div></div></div></div><script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.2.1/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="https://unpkg.com/bootstrap@3.3.7/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script></body></html>
