<p>I&#8217;ve great news to share. Today I&#8217;m announcing the <strong>Persistence Hub</strong> and giving you a first glimpse inside.</p>



<p>2 weeks ago, I announced that we stop offering online courses as one-off purchases. Instead, we will offer a membership including all my courses, a community forum, and interactive live events. Combining all of these will provide you with the ideal environment to solve problems in your current project and support your life-long improvement as a software developer.</p>



<p>Since that announcement, my team and I have worked hard behind the scenes to set up the new membership. You might&#8217;ve recognized the layout changes, and we had to replace a part of the technology stack to add the community functionality.</p>

<p><strong><strong>The doors to the Persistence Hub will open with a special launch offer on Black Friday, November 26th, 2021.&nbsp;</strong></strong></p>



<p>That&#8217;s in only 3 weeks, and I recommend you mark it in your calendar. Joining during the launch week will secure you the lowest price for the lifetime of your subscription. As long you don&#8217;t cancel your membership, you will stay at that price forever.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s take a closer look at some of the things included in your <strong>Persistence Hub</strong> membership.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Courses</h2>



<p>As a member, you get access to the certification classes of my online courses JPA for Beginners, Advanced Hibernate, Spring Data JPA, Data and Communication Patterns for Microservices, and the new version of my Hibernate Performance Tuning course.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="898" height="937" src="https://thorben-janssen.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Courses.png" alt="" class="wp-image-34956" srcset="https://thorben-janssen.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Courses.png 898w, https://thorben-janssen.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Courses-288x300.png 288w, https://thorben-janssen.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Courses-768x801.png 768w, https://thorben-janssen.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Courses-624x651.png 624w, https://thorben-janssen.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Courses-48x50.png 48w, https://thorben-janssen.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Courses-96x100.png 96w" sizes="(max-width: 898px) 100vw, 898px" /></figure>



<p>I&#8217;m currently adding new lectures and exercises to the Hibernate Performance Tuning course and updating it for Hibernate 6. Hibernate 6 is expected to be released at the end of this year. With the launch of the membership, you will get early access to the new version of my Hibernate Performance Tuning course, and its final version will become part of the Persistence Hub in December.</p>



<p>In the first half of 2022, I will release a similar update for my Advanced Hibernate course. I will rerecord all videos, provide additional examples based on Hibernate 6 and add new lectures.</p>



<p>After these 2 updates are done, I will start working on a new course, which will, of course, also be available to all members. I have several topics in mind, and all members will be able to vote on them.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="live">Upcoming Q&amp;A Calls and Expert Sessions</h2>



<p>In addition to the course library, your membership will give you access to live Q&amp;A calls and Expert Sessions. All of them will be recorded and become part of the Persistence Hub library. For the rest of this year, I&#8217;ve planned the following live events:</p>
